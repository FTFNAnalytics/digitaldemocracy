# Per-country office tier classification

Checked-in files here map each package office ID to a proposed Atlas tier and to
schema v1 `GovernmentTier` (`national_context` / `regional` / `municipal` /
`council` / `other`).

These files are the Atlas classifiers. Workbook calendar cohort strings such as
Albania `Regional / municipal` are **not** classifiers.

Files were rebuilt from each package’s office register (one row per `office_id`;
no invented IDs). See [docs/phase0/REPORT.md](../../../docs/phase0/REPORT.md).
Albania municipal and Alderney `other` are **`approved`**. Andorra and Armenia
remain **`draft_for_human_review`**.

| File | Register rows | Proposed tier | Human review |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| [`albania.json`](albania.json) | 122 | `municipal` (61 mayors + 61 councils) | **Approved** 2026-09-16 (Justin). Regional=0 is intentional. |
| [`andorra.json`](andorra.json) | 7 | `municipal` (communal councils) | Empty regional-calendar demo |
| [`alderney.json`](alderney.json) | 2 | `other` | **Approved** 2026-09-16 (product owner). Channel Islands are low priority for the broader Atlas. |
| [`armenia.json`](armenia.json) | 71 | `municipal` (community offices) | Boundary/calendar flags; keep municipal |

Vocabulary uses `national` as a proposed label. `schema_compatibility` maps
`national` → schema v1 `national_context`.

**Alderney:** `GG-ALD-STATES` and `GG-ALD-PLEB` are **approved** `other`
(territorial legislature / representation). Seat counts are not extra office
IDs. Product owner approved 2026-09-16; Channel Islands remain low priority
for the broader Atlas.

**Armenia** is last among early European targets. Proportional councils elect
the mayor; missing mayor rows were not invented. Prompt token `AM-VEDI` is
register `AM-VEDI-C`.

**Albania:** all 122 office-register rows are **approved** `municipal` (Justin,
2026-09-16) for Phase 1 storage proof. Regional count is 0 by design. Do not
invent regional or national offices. The importer must hash the accepted file
bytes; this schema has no self-hash field.

Phase 1 still needs the Albania importer and import proof. Checking in these
files is not Albania storage proof and is not a populated regional calendar.
